C++ template class revision:

 - generic class
	-> because in a class 
		-> data and operation are the same 
		-> but data type is not the same (E.g. int and float)
	Therefore:
		-> The current variables and functions inside the class
		   will no longer work
			(Not like javascript -> C++ is strong type language)
	 	-> [ !!! ] There will be a lot of copy, paste and a little edit of code
		   of work to do
			=> if we only create an other data type class but with
			   same variable and function. 
		-> No!!!
		-> C++ provide the same class but with multiple data types

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   => [ template class ]  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! -> generic class
